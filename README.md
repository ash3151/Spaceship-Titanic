Using ML algorithms to predict whether passengers are transported or not.
This is a famous dataset from Kaggle website.
Traning and Testing data is provided seperately, I got the data from Kaggle website.

1. We do data preprocessing, see if there are any null values/ missing values and deal with them.
2. Filling null values with mean of whole feature values.
3. Performing EDA(exploratory data analysis) to gain insights in features.
4. Spliting training data into further train and text using sklearn train_test_split.
5. Using various ML models and comparing accuracy between them.
